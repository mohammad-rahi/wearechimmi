                        <p>In 2010, more than 70,000 LGBTQ+ people and their allies uploaded videos and stories to
                            provide hope and encouragement to the LGTBQ+ youth with the message: It Gets Better. This
                            was the birth of a wildly successful global movement born out of social media. Today It Gets
                            Better (IGB) is a non-profit organization that reaches millions of young people each year
                            with the mission to uplift, empower, and connect LGBTQ+ youth around the globe through
                            powerful storytelling campaigns, educational programming and resources, and dynamic
                            community building initiatives. The organization also works with international affiliates in
                            19 countries to further spread their message of hope to the LGBTQ+ youth.</p>

                        <p>The It Gets Better Project connects daily more than 1.65 million followers across <span
                                class="color_primary">Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Tumblr,
                                Twitch,</span> and <span class="color_primary">ItGetsBetter.org</span>. Their work has
                            been translated into an award-winning MTV special, a NY Times bestselling book, museum
                            exhibits, and live performances – and in 2012 was awarded the Governor’s Award for use of
                            media to educate and inspire. </p>
                        <p>We had the opportunity to meet with Chair and President of IGB, Paul Dien, to learn more
                            about the organization, the challenges they’re facing, and the strength of storytelling and
                            social media.</p>

                        <h5>What is the founding story of IGB?</h5>
                        <p>Over ten years ago, It Gets Better was started by Dan Savage, who is a famous activist and
                            columnist. And this was really at a time post-Matthew Shepard where the national narrative
                            was dark. And what we were trying to do was create a movement that was empowering young
                            people and create a hopeful world where it didn't feel so dark and be a lighthouse of
                            positivity. And then it just became a grassroots viral campaign at first where videos were
                            being uploaded by all folks from all walks of life. And then we had celebrities, from Lady
                            Gaga to RuPaul to President Obama, record their own videos of messages and hope. But what's
                            amazing about that founding story was it's rooted in social media and flipping the script on
                            creating these conversations of hope, again, when it feels so dark.</p>
                        <p>And I feel like we're now at a time where these culture wars are happening but now we have
                            more resources and more relationships with content creators, where we aren't just uploading
                            videos of hope. I think we're meeting young folks, Gen Z folks, where they're at in this
                            moment. And I think that's the power of working with young people. It's constantly changing.
                            The demographics change, culture changes, the way they consume media changes. The culture
                            has shifted from 10 years ago when the conversation was very focused on white, cisgender men
                            and we are really celebrating intersectionality diversity. And I think that's such a
                            critical part and a personal mission for me because I became the board chair three years
                            ago. It really put an authentic stamp on diversity inclusion, so it’s been a fun next
                            chapter. The background of where it started was amazing. But now it's like, okay, how can we
                            grow it and evolve it and make it bigger given the culture wars and that the community is
                            under assault in a different manner now?</p>

                        <h5>What is IGB’s mission?</h5>
                        <p>Our mission is really to uplift and empower LGBTQ youth. What we're trying to do is provide
                            storytelling that's uplifting and reflects the LGBTQ view, the importance of why they
                            matter, why our community matters, and what we can do to continuously celebrate and empower
                            young LGBTQ folks. It's a very tricky time for our community. There are over 220 anti-LGBTQ
                            bills that are happening across our country. So we are doubling down and we feel like we are
                            a ray of light during a dark time in the national narrative. And in addition, what's really
                            exciting about the organization is we have over 17 affiliates globally. So from countries
                            from India to Brazil to Colombia, we're really trying to create a footprint and a grassroots
                            movement, not only in our country, but around the world. </p>

                        <h5>What are some of the biggest issues IGB is tackling at the moment?</h5>

                        <p>The 220 anti-LGBTW bills in Congress. It's a huge one. And we've already seen some of them
                            pass like “Don’t Say Gay” in Florida and the anti-trans bill in Texas. And it’s gonna be an
                            election year in two years. So I don't think this is going away. This is a long-term
                            strategy for us. And I think 50 states. 50 grants. 5,000 voices. is a big part of actual
                            impact, to combat all the negativity and darkness that the other side's trying to bring in
                            terms of public policy.</p>

                        <img src="./assets/images/News_sample3.png" alt="">

                        <h5>How can people help or get involved, especially allies?</h5>
                        <p>I think it's essentially just going to our website. There are a bunch of different
                            initiatives and campaigns in which you can donate to. There are also resources and content
                            that you can share to friends and families that might need this work. At the end of the day,
                            it is to help folks that might be struggling or to help families that may not understand.
                            It's important to just share that there are folks doing this work and to continue empowering
                            others, especially our young folks to create a more hopeful, inclusive world. I think our
                            tone is not to be cheesy. We know how critical this work is because we know how hard it is.
                            I think you need the hope, the lightness, the humour and the cleverness to combat the
                            darkness. There's authenticity in acknowledging the darkness. But I think what we're trying
                            to do is face it with our own brand and our own messaging that hopefully will inspire folks.
