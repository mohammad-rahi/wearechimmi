                        <p>Hoa’s parents were refugees from Vietnam and Laos who resettled in the U.S. Sunny’s family
                            immigrated from South Korea to the U.S. for better opportunities. Our parents showed us the
                            value of hustling and how a hard work ethic can lead to success, especially in the face of
                            adversity. We met in NYC and bonded over our cultural pride and in overindulging in Asian
                            cuisines, all of which led to the birth of WE ARE CHIMMI.</p>
                        <p>WE ARE CHIMMI, short for "We Are Children of Immigrants," is a community building platform
                            that
                            celebrates the immigrant hustle. We sell accessories we grew up loving and <b>donate 10% of
                                profits
                                from sales to organizations supporting immigrants and marginalized communities.</b>
                            Currently, we
                            are donating to <span class="color_primary">Welcome to Chinatown</span> and <span
                                class="color_primary">It Gets Better</span>. Organizations we have
                            donated to in the
                            past to include: </p>
